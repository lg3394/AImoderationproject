AI MODERATION PROJECT â€“ DATA DIARY

25/11 - 02/12

Watched tutorials and researched different AI moderation APIs

Built basic gradio app - had to delete from HuggingFace space because I didn't know how to not make it interfere with ChatGPT test

10/12

I integrated the gradio app code with OpenAI's content moderation API. I encountered an error because I needed to 'migrate' OpenAI.
I installed OpenAI using the command line. Before I could execute 'openai migrate' I had to download Grit CLI,
a command-line tool that OpenAI integrates with its library to assist developers in tasks such as migration, debugging,
and interacting with OpenAI services. It simplifies certain development workflows by providing utilities directly in the command line.
I solved this by resorting to using the 0.28 version of OpenAI

Perplexity

Doesn't seem to offer one?

POTENTIAL USES

Feed a specific text? Just make the app and people can try different things?
